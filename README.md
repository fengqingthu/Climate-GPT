Climate-GPT is a chatbot that raises awareness of climate change in a nuanced way, serving all types of mass-customized mediums. Implemented by Qing Feng (Harvard GSD Mediums '23), this app is part of his MDes Open Project. Climate-GPT is built on top of [OpenAI APIs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/quickstart) for the chat, image generation, and voice transcription endpoints, and [Eleven Labs APIs](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/quickstart) for sythesized speeches. 

You can follow the instructions below to get set up. Also, [check out our deployment here](https://www.climate-gpt.com). Climate-GPT leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5, Dall-e-2, and whisper-1 models.

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd Climate-GPT
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment

   $ python -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```
